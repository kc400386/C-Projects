My teacher at FGCU showed us how to make this program so I cant take credit for it but I have added signifcant changes since then. In this project a solder (I mispelled soilder early on in the project but thought it was funny so I kept it) fights a random enemy and does damage until the enemy dies than moves on until it dies. Where the user can then chose to end the program or repeat it.
